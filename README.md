# E-Commerce-Back-End-ORM

## Description
The goal of this assigment is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. The end result is a working Express.js API using Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The demo below shows how to run the schema, seed the data, and start your server. Then, using Insomnia, it shows you the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests for each Model (Category, Product, and Tag).
